Welcome to the CBIOMES-global documentation!
============================================

Here, you will learn about simple methods that are available to download,
analyze, or compute `CBIOMES-global` solutions. The prototype solution,
`CBIOMES-global (alpha version)`, is a global ocean state estimate
that covers the period from 1992 to 2011. It is based on :cite:`for-eta:15` for
ocean physics and :cite:`dut-eta:15` for marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems.
