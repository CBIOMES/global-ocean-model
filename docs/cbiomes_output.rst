The `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)` monthly climatology has been interpolated
to a :math:`1/2\times1/2^\circ` grid (see :ref:`interpolate`) and reformatted as
`Netcdf <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`__ files (see :ref:`reformat`).
It can thus be displayed using any `Netcdf`-enabled
software (e.g., `Panoply <http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/>`__
under `Windows`, `Linux`, or `macOS`).

The `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)` climatology folder is currently accessed
via `dropbox`. It contains additional documentation -- e.g., the
`solution booklet` that extensively depicts `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)`
and is readily reproducible by users -- as well
as the native grid output that allows for accurate, global
computations (see :numref:`download-tools` and :numref:`postprocess`).

   dropbox folders (since they are not yet publicly available).
