The `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)` monthly climatology has been interpolated
to a :math:`1/2\times1/2^\circ` grid (see :ref:`interpolate`) and reformatted as
`Netcdf <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`__ files (see :ref:`reformat`).

The `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)` climatology folder can currently be accessed
via `dropbox`. It contains additional documentation including the
`solution booklet` -- a `pdf` file that extensively depicts
`CBIOMES-global (alpha version)` and that users can regenerate
themselves (see :numref:`postprocess`).

.. note::

   Please contact us to get access to the dropbox folders (since they are not yet public).
