The `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)` monthly climatology has been interpolated
to a :math:`1/2\times1/2^\circ` grid (see :ref:`interpolate`) and converted to
`Netcdf <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`__ files (see
:ref:`reformat`) that can readily be visualized using any `Netcdf`-enabled
software (e.g., `Panoply <http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/>`__
under `Windows`, `Linux`, or `macOS`).

The climatology folder is currently accessed
via `dropbox`. It contains additional documentation -- e.g., the
`solution booklet` that extensively depicts `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)`
-- and native grid output that allows for accurate computational
analyses (see :numref:`download-tools` and :numref:`postprocess`).

.. note::

   Please contact us to get access to the
   dropbox folders -- they are not publicly available yet.
