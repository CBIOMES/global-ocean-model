The `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)` monthly climatology has been interpolated
to a :math:`1/2\times1/2^\circ` grid (see :ref:`interpolate`) and reformatted as
`Netcdf <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`__ files (see :ref:`reformat`).
The climatology folder can currently be accessed via `dropbox` (see below).
It also contains the `solution booklet`, a `pdf` file generated as explained in
:numref:`analyze`, that is a compilation of several hundred pictures
documenting various aspects of `CBIOMES-global (alpha version)`.

.. note::

   Please contact us to get access to the dropbox folders (since they are not yet public).
