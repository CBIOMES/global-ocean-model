## Fitting marine ecosystem models to data

The Simons Collaboration on Computational Biogeochemical Modeling of Marine Ecosystems (CBIOMES; [cbiomes.org](https://cbiomes.org); [cbiomes@github](https://github.com/CBIOMES)) seeks to develop and apply quantitative models of the structure and function of marine microbial communities at local to basin scales. Emerging autonomous platform technologies provide a wealth of new biogeochemical and ecological information.  Combining these new data sets with the satellite record of ocean color, ship-based data collections, and numerical models will improve our monitoring and understanding of marine ecosystems over the global ocean. 

**In this postdoctoral project**, with [our group](http://darwinproject.mit.edu) at [MIT](https://eapsweb.mit.edu), you will exploit a state of the art Global Ocean model already constrained by Argo and satellite data for ocean physics. Its detailed representation of plankton communities open unique opportunities for direct, quantitative comparison with bio-chemical and bio-optical data. Your research scope will include the application of innovative probabilistic and/or parameter estimation methods to minimize model-data misfits over the seasonal cycle. You will thus derive best-estimates of the state of global marine ecosystems and a mechanistic understanding of their evolution over the observed record.
